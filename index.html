				<p>In Major League Baseball there are two leages- the American League and the National League- and most games are played between teams in the same league.  One of the primary differences is that pitchers bat in the NL while the AL (since 1973) replaces them with more skilled "Designated Hitters".  This has had a profound effect on the scoring in each league.  The team that scores the most runs is almost always from the American League while the team that gives up the fewest runs is almost always from the National League.</p>
				<p>The data comes from Lahman's Baseball Database.  Data prior to the 1969 season has been excluded since this was the first season with league play and an expanded postseason.</p>
