				<h1>What happens before and after a world series win?</h1>
				<p>In Major League Baseball the ultimate goal is winning the World Series.  At the end of the season (as in most professional sports leagues) teams that performed well will try to make a few minor changes to improve the team without risking what they already have, while poor performing teams may decide to "rebuild" and dramatically reshape their roster.  How does this actually work out in reality?  It would be helpful to look at the performance of teams changes from year to year.</p>
				<p>The data comes from Lahman's Baseball Database.  Data prior to the 1969 season has been excluded since this was the first season with league play and an expanded postseason.</p>
